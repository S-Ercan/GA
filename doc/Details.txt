Genetic algorithms

Application:
    Scheduling problem
    Generate random problem instances

Algorithm:
    Represent population of candidate solutions as array of values
    While termination condition is not met:
        Apply fitness evaluation
        Take certain proportion of fittest individuals
        Apply genetic operators to create next generation

Details:
    Approximate fitness function
    Adaptive GA: adapt p(genetic operator) based on population information
    Termination conditions:
        Maximum number of generations reached
        Fitness threshold reached

Components:
    Random problem generator
    Problem representation
    Genetic algorithm implementation

MAXSAT

Create problems consisting of a number of variables v and clauses c
Clauses contain disjunction of positive/negative literals
A population consists of a number of individuals having v genes with value 0/1
Objective function is number of clauses satisfied
