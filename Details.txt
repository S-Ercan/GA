Genetic algorithms

Application:
    Scheduling problem
    Generate random problem instances

Algorithm:
    Represent population of candidate solutions as array of values
    While termination condition is not met:
        Apply fitness evaluation
        Take certain proportion of fittest individuals
        Apply genetic operators to create next generation

Details:
    Approximate fitness function
    Adaptive GA: adapt p(genetic operator) based on population information

Components:
    Random problem generator
    Genetic algorithm implementation
